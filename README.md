## Problem Statement
Tourism is one of the most rapidly growing global industries and tourism forecasting is
becoming an increasingly important activity in planning and managing the industry.
Because of high fluctuations of tourism demand, accurate predictions of purchase of
travel packages are of high importance for tourism organizations.
## Approach
The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.
## Goal
The goal is to predict whether the customer will purchase the tourism package or not.
## Dataset

## Data Preprocessing
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Univariate and Bivariate Visualization
3. Outlier Removal
4. Missing Value Imputation
5. One-Hot Encoding
6. Feature Transformation
7. Over Sampling - SMOTE
## Model Fitting
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. XGboost Classifier
4. SVM Classifier
5. KNN Classifier
6. CatBoost Classifier
### Note
Here we have used recall value instead of using accuracy beacause here we want to classify those records which are going to purchase the tourism package.
## HyperParameter Tuning
1. Grid Search CV
2. Randomized Search CV
## Best Fitting Model
K-Nearest Neighbour has given the high recall value of 93.65%
## Model Deployment
Deploy the model using Flask on Heroku platform
